# New Arrivals Chi - Architecture

TODO:
- Write a summary of your application's architecture aimed at onboarding a new team member.
- What key details do they need to know?
- Where does data come from?
- How does data flow through the system?
- What is the relationship between different modules? (I strongly suggest creating a dependency graph to show which modules depend upon which. If your graph is convoluted that is a sign that you may need to consider refactoring at some point.)
- What key concepts does the user need to understand?
