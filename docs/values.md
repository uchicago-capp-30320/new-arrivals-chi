## Project Values 

### Acknowledging Privilege and Power Dynamics, Building Trust

We come from a place of privilege and are working with a group that has experienced and continues to experience significant trauma - significant effort is needed to build trust. As designers, it is important to be aware of their privileges and prioritize strategies to address power differentials with marginalized groups and external stakeholders upfront.

We acknowledge that we risk injecting our own biases in assumptions throughout the design process i.e., in building personas. In an effort to mitigate this, our decision-making process will center the feedback of our community partners who work daily with new arrivals.

### Privacy and Security

People who are marginalized experience disproportionate harm when their privacy is violated.
We place a high importance on sharing reliable, vetted information and contacts. In this space, quality over quantity is essential.

On the front end, we place a high value on making the tool accessible (screen readable, diversity of language) and trustworthy.

On the backend, we place a high value on creating a secure infrastructure.

We have chosen not to collect any information from new arrivals to reduce any risk of violation of their privacy.

There may be some information available for service providers that will not be available to the general public. The backend infrastructure will place a high value on security and privacy of any information that is not public. Our generative AI policy also lays out specific guidelines for protecting this information.

### Respect for Users

User feedback is the guiding principle for our decision-making.
