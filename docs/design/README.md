# Project Design

## Design Principles

Our design process was grounded in the following principles:

1. *User -entered*: New Migrants and Community Based Organizations are the designers, our role is to execute what they need. 
2. *Secure*: New Migrants are uniquely vulnerable if their information is compromised. Security above all else.
3. *Accurate*: This tool is providing information that may significantly impact people's life - accuracy and reliability of information is of the utmost importance
4. *Actionable*: Every new arrival faces unique needs and challenges, and this app is just one resource. We will focus on what a website is well-suited for: providing real-time, accurate, and actionable information. The goal is to free up staff and volunteer time to address issues requiring personalized attention and to advocate for systemic changes.

## Design Decisions

Our design decisions are guided by our conversations with community partners and end-users. You can view a summary of our meeting notes from our discussions with community partners [here](docs/design/stakeholder_meetings.md) and can read more about our design decisions [here](docs/decisions/design.md).
