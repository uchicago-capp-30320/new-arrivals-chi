An Individual may prove employment eligibility with the Employment Authorization Document (EAD) or other documentation allowable in the I-9 employment eligibility process, such as a state identification documentation. If an individual uses an SSN that states, “Valid for Employment Only with DHS Authorization,” they will need to show their EAD. Employers should not use the I-9 form as a screening tool and should request it only at the time of hire, up to and including the first day of work. Individuals with T or U visas generally become eligible for a green card after three years. Filing for a green card extends T or U nonimmigrant status, so the expiration of the work permit while the green card application is pending does not necessarily mean these individuals are ineligible to work. Individuals may apply for an EAD while waiting for legal permanent residency.') }}
