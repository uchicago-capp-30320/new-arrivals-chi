  <h1>{{ _('Renters Rights') }}</h1>

  <h2>{{ _('Basic Rights') }}</h2>
  <p>{{ _('All people have the right to a safe and stable home to build better futures for themselves and their families. In Illinois, you have the right to:') }}</p>

  <h3>{{ _('Live in a Safe, Reasonably Maintained Home') }}</h3>
  <p>{{ _('Your landlord is responsible for maintaining running water, electricity, and heat, based on the specific requirements of local building codes. If your heat is not functioning during the winter, your landlord has 24 hours to respond to your complaint with plans to resolve the issue.') }}</p>

  <h3>{{ _('Ask for repairs to your rental unit') }}</h3>
  <p>{{ _('You have the right to repairs made within 14 days (or 72 hours in an emergency) that do not exceed $500 or half of the monthly rent, whichever is less.') }}</p>

    <li>{{ _('If the landlord refuses to make repairs, submit a formal letter with your rent.') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('If the landlord still does not make repair by the given deadline, you have the right to hire a licensed professional to make the repairs and deduct the costs from your rent with a receipt.') }}</li>
  </ul>

  <p>{{ _('Complain to any governmental authority or testify in court about the state of your unit and enjoy equal protection under the law.') }}</p>

  <h3>{{ _('Retaliatory Eviction Act') }}</h3>
  <p>{{ _('You have the right to report a complaint to any governmental authority about a violation of a building code, health ordinance, or similar regulation without threat of eviction or refusal to renew the lease.') }}</p>

  <h3>{{ _('Rent Increases') }}</h3>
  <p>{{ _('In Illinois, landlords cannot raise rent* during the time period of a written or a verbal lease. For month-to-month tenants, the landlord must provide 30 days’ notice, and for week-to-week tenants, they must provide seven days’ notice before the rent is due. (*Separate rules for notifying rent increases apply for federally subsidized housing.)') }}</p>

  <h2>{{ _('Residential Tenant and Landlord Ordinance') }}</h2>
  <p>{{ _('Every tenant in Illinois is covered by Illinois laws, but Chicago has local laws, called ordinances, that apply to landlords and tenants regardless of immigration status. These ordinances cover the rights and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords. Your landlord should provide you with a written summary of the RTLO with your lease.') }}</p>

  <h3>{{ _('Cook County Residential Tenant and Landlord Ordinance') }}</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>{{ _('Prevents landlords from charging late fees greater than $10 a month for the monthly rent of up to $1,000, plus 5 percent per month for the monthly rent over $1,000.') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Limits security deposits to no more than one and a half months’ rent. Security deposits must be returned within 30 days after the tenant has left the unit. If a reasonable amount has been deducted for repairs, the landlord must provide an itemized list of damages and costs for repairs.') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Landlords cannot threaten to, attempt to, or forcefully remove a tenant without authority of the law. For example, landlords cannot change the locks, shut off utilities, or do anything else that interferes with the tenant’s use of the apartment.') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Lockouts are always illegal, but the Cook County RTLO adds extra protections. In Cook County, you can sue your landlord for up to two months’ rent or twice the damages sustained by the tenant, whichever is greater. In municipalities outside of the City of Chicago, violations should be made to the Cook County Sheriff\'s Office at 773-674-4357.') }}</li>

    <li>{{ _('Security deposits must be returned, minus any expenses for damages, within 45 days after the tenant has left the unit.') }}</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>{{ _('Lockouts and Evictions') }}</h3>
  <p>{{ _('A landlord cannot forcibly enter your home, change the locks, break down the door, or cut off access to utilities in an attempt to evict you, pursuant to the Forcible Entry and Detainer Act. The County Sheriff can forcibly retake possession for a landlord only on order from a judge, only after the landlord wins an eviction lawsuit and the tenant refuses to leave.') }}</p>

  <p>{{ _('DON\'T SELF EVICT! An eviction notice is not the same as an eviction. ​​An initial eviction notice is only the first step in the eviction process. It does not mean that the tenant has to move out immediately, and it does not necessarily mean that the tenant will have to appear in court. There will still be a chance to resolve the issue directly with the landlord, outside of court.') }}</p>

  <h2>{{ _('Eviction Process') }}</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>{{ _('Eviction Notice: The landlord personally serves a signed, written notice on the tenant or on anyone 13 years or older who lives at the property, or sends one by certified mail with a signed returned receipt.') }}</li>

    <li>{{ _('If Tenant Stays After Eviction Order: The tenant is forcibly removed (only by law enforcement, never the landlord).') }}</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>{{ _('Types of Eviction Notices') }}</h2>
  <p>{{ _('The reason for eviction determines some aspects of the eviction process—mainly, how many days a tenant has to resolve the issue or fight the eviction in court.') }}</p>

  <h3>{{ _('5 Day Notice') }}</h3>
  <p>{{ _('Nonpayment of Rent: Upon receiving this written notice, the tenant can avoid going to court by repaying the past due rent in full within five days. In Illinois, if the landlord accepts partial payment of rent, the eviction becomes invalid, unless the notice states that only full payment of rent will waive the landlord’s right to terminate the lease. In Chicago, the eviction process becomes invalid if the landlord accepts any payment of partial rent at all.') }}</p>

  <p>{{ _('Illegal Activity: A tenant may receive this written notice if they have committed a class X felony, such as armed robbery, aggravated battery, or aggravated arson.') }}</p>

  <h3>{{ _('10 Day Notice') }}</h3>

  </ul>

  <h3>{{ _('Protections for When Your Residence is Sold') }}</h3>
  <p>{{ _('Tenants must be informed that the property has been sold and they have a new landlord within 10 days of purchase. If a building/unit is sold, all oral or written leases remain valid for the duration of the lease. New landlords cannot raise rents, remove tenants, force tenants to sign a new lease, or withhold security deposits for a purchased property. The new landlord is responsible for obtaining all pertinent documents and deposits from the former owner and paying security deposits back when the tenant leaves.') }}</p>

  <h3>{{ _('90 Day Notice') }}</h3>
  <p>{{ _('Foreclosure of Unit: A tenant may receive this written notice if their unit is part of property that has been foreclosed upon and their rental cannot continue. Tenants have 90 days to move regardless of whether they have a verbal or written lease.') }}</p>

  <h2>{{ _('Protections Based on Immigration Status') }}</h2>
  <h3>{{ _('Disclosure of Immigration Status') }}</h3>

  <h3>{{ _('Immigrant Tenant Protection Act (ITPA)') }}</h3>
  <p>{{ _('This law went into effect in August 2019. It prohibits Illinois landlords from harassing, threatening, or evicting tenants based on actual or perceived immigration or citizenship status.') }}</p>

  <h3>{{ _('Right to Free Interpretation and Translation Services') }}</h3>

Landlords should make sure tenants understand the lease and provide it in alternate formats (e.g. provide the written lease in Spanish). If the landlord refuses to provide a lease in a certain language, it may be a violation of Fair Housing or other civil rights laws, and you should consult an attorney.') }}</p>

  <p>{{ _('All individuals have the right to request an interpreter in any Illinois court when they check in with the clerk for civil cases. The services of court foreign language interpreters are provided at no cost to the individual in need of the service, consistent with the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure and the judicial circuit’s Language Access Plan (735 ILCS 5/8-1403).') }}</p>

  <h2>{{ _('What to Do If You Are Locked Out or Illegally Evicted') }}</h2>
  <p>{{ _('Lockouts are always illegal regardless of immigration status. Call an attorney or trusted housing organization to file a police report with the county sheriff. If you\'re in Chicago, report it to the Chicago Police Department. See resources on pages 15-24. In an emergency, call 911. Be prepared to give the police or dispatcher your name and address as well as the landlord’s name and phone number.

For example, landlords cannot write sexual favors into the terms of a lease or refuse to rent to a tenant because of their response to harassment.') }}</p>

  <h2>{{ _('Safe Homes Act') }}</h2>
  <p>{{ _('If you have been in a violent or abusive housing situation (such as domestic violence, child abuse, or elder abuse), you and your family have the right to: Break your lease and leave the home without having to continue paying rent, as long as you give the landlord written notice three days before or after you leave the home, and/or Request an emergency lock change via written notice to keep the abuser out of the home in an emergency situation.
